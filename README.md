### **💻 About Me**

I am a Junior AI Engineer currently working at a GeoAI company. My focus is on spatial data analysis, remote sensing, and GeoAI. I am passionate about processing geospatial data and transforming it into actionable insights that are truly useful.

### **🔍 What Excites Me**

I love exploring data science, machine learning, and deep learning for geospatial analysis and Earth observation. Tools such as Google Earth Engine, Rasterio, QGIS, geopandas, GDAL, and Folium are some of my favorite resources for tackling these challenges.

### 💡 Knowledge Sharing

Sharing knowledge is something that excites me deeply. During my university days, I had the opportunity to teach through volunteer work, and as a student teacher at an elder school. These experiences allowed me to pass on what I had learned. Now, I continue this passion by sharing my knowledge and projects through my blog and GitHub.
